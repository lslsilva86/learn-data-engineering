## Understanding DBMS and Data Warehouse Use Cases

This lecture provides a comparative understanding of **DBMS** (Database Management Systems) and **Data Warehouses**, their purposes, and the types of problems they solve. It highlights the operational focus of DBMS versus the analytical focus of Data Warehouses.

### Key Points:

#### **DBMS Use Cases**:

- Primarily used for **transactional operations** in real-time applications.
- Examples of DBMS technologies: **Oracle**, **Postgres**, **MySQL**, **SQL Server**.
- **Problem Statements Solved**:
  1. **Buying a Product**:
     - Handles transactions like purchases between a customer and a company.
  2. **Order Tracking**:
     - Tracks the real-time status of orders (processing, shipped, or delivered).
  3. **Order Cancellation and Refunds**:
     - Manages refund processes when a customer cancels an order.

#### **Data Warehouse Use Cases**:

- Primarily used for **analytical and decision-making** purposes, focusing on trends and insights.
- **End Users**:
  - Typically executives (e.g., CTOs, VPs, Directors) looking to evaluate organizational performance.
- **Problem Statements Solved**:
  1. **Profitability Analysis**:
     - Example: "What is the profitability of the organization from the start of the month until yesterday?"
  2. **Revenue Trends**:
     - Example: "What is the revenue trend over this year?"
  3. **Category Performance**:
     - Identifying which product categories are performing well or poorly (e.g., electronics vs. groceries).
- Data from warehouses or lakes is used to generate **reports and dashboards** for decision-making.

### Differences Between DBMS and Data Warehouses:

- **Purpose**:
  - DBMS: Operational and real-time transaction handling.
  - Data Warehouse: Analytical, focusing on historical trends and insights.
- **Use Case Scope**:
  - DBMS: Transactional systems like order processing and refunds.
  - Data Warehouse: Reporting and analytics for executive decision-making.
