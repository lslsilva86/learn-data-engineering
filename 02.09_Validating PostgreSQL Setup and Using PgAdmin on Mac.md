## Validating PostgreSQL Setup and Using PgAdmin on Mac

This lecture outlines the process of validating the PostgreSQL server setup on a Mac using **PgAdmin** and demonstrates how to connect to the local PostgreSQL database and run SQL queries.

#### **Steps for Validation and Setup**

1. **Launch PgAdmin**:

   - Use **Spotlight Search** to locate and open PgAdmin.
   - The first launch may take some time to initialize.

2. **Set the Master Password**:

   - Create a **master password** for PgAdmin (separate from the PostgreSQL superuser password).
   - This password is used to secure PgAdmin and is required each time you launch it.

3. **Connect to PostgreSQL Server**:

   - PgAdmin lists the available database servers.
   - Enter the **PostgreSQL server password** (set during the PostgreSQL installation) to connect.
   - Optionally, save the password to avoid re-entering it in the future.

4. **Validate Connection**:
   - Upon successful connection, the default database (`Postgres`) is displayed.
   - PostgreSQL supports multi-tenant databases, meaning multiple databases can exist within one server installation.

#### **Exploring the PgAdmin Interface**

- **Database Details**:

  - Expand the server to view database details, schemas, and other metadata.
  - The default schema, `information_schema`, contains metadata about the database structure.

- **Using the Query Tool**:
  - Right-click on a database (e.g., `Postgres`) and select **Query Tool** to open the SQL editor.
  - The Query Tool allows you to write and execute SQL queries.

#### **Running SQL Queries**

- Example Query to List Tables:
  ```sql
  SELECT *
  FROM information_schema.tables;
  ```
  - This query retrieves a list of tables in the database.
  - The result is displayed in the output pane of the Query Tool.

#### **Key Takeaways**

- **PgAdmin Setup**:

  - PgAdmin is pre-installed with PostgreSQL and serves as a management interface for local and remote PostgreSQL servers.
  - It provides tools to create, manage, and query databases.

- **Validation**:

  - Successful connection and query execution confirm that PostgreSQL is properly installed and accessible on the local machine.

- **Multi-Tenant Support**:

  - PostgreSQL installations can host multiple databases, with the `Postgres` database as the default.

- **SQL Query Tool**:
  - PgAdmin's Query Tool is used to interact with databases, retrieve metadata, and perform various database tasks.

This concludes the validation and basic usage of PgAdmin to connect and query a PostgreSQL database on Mac.
