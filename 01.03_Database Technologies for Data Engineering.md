## Database Technologies for Data Engineering

This lecture provides an overview of various **RDBMS** and **Data Warehouse technologies**, emphasizing their relevance for **data engineering** and application architecture. The focus is on **revising SQL** using PostgreSQL, while highlighting the broader landscape of database technologies.

### Key Points:

#### Categories of Database Technologies:

1. **RDBMS (Relational Database Management Systems)**:

   - Examples: Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, Sybase, IBM DB2.
   - Used for **transactional applications** like retail or e-commerce systems.
   - **PostgreSQL** is highlighted as a popular open-source choice.

2. **Data Warehouse Technologies**:

   - Examples: Snowflake, Databricks, Teradata, GCP BigQuery, AWS Redshift, Azure Synapse.
   - Used for **analytics applications**, not transactional systems.
   - Focused on large-scale data storage and analysis.

3. **NoSQL Databases**:
   - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, HBase.
   - Used for non-relational, schema-less data storage needs.

#### Importance of SQL:

- **SQL is universal** across these database technologies, with only minor syntax variations (e.g., fetching top rows in Oracle vs. MySQL/PostgreSQL).
- Acts as a "remote control" to interact with different "TVs" (databases).

#### Differences Between RDBMS and Data Warehouses:

- RDBMS: Used for **real-time, transactional systems**.
- Data Warehouses: Designed for **batch processing and analytics**.

### Practical Focus:

1. Use **PostgreSQL** for SQL revision due to its open-source nature and ease of setup.
2. Understand **subtle SQL differences** across databases (e.g., `LIMIT` vs. `TOP` for row selection).
3. After mastering SQL, expand to other relevant tools and technologies for data engineering:
   - **Programming Languages**: Python.
   - **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, Azure, GCP.
   - **Data Warehouse Tools**: Snowflake, Databricks, Redshift, Synapse.

### Key Takeaway:

SQL serves as a foundational skill for data engineering, and understanding its application across RDBMS and data warehouse technologies is crucial. Begin with SQL revision using PostgreSQL, then gradually explore other tools and technologies relevant to data engineering.
