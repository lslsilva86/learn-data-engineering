## Setting Up and Using PostgreSQL Databases with PgAdmin

This lecture provides a detailed explanation of how PostgreSQL database servers and PgAdmin are used together to manage databases, set up connections, and perform system tasks. Below are the key points summarized:

---

#### **Overview of PostgreSQL Database Server**

1. **PostgreSQL as an RDBMS Technology**:

   - PostgreSQL is a multi-tenant database server, allowing multiple databases within a single server installation.
   - A default database named `Postgres` is created during installation, along with a superuser named `postgres`.

2. **Multi-Database Support**:

   - Each application (e.g., HR, vendor management, retail) can have its own database within the same PostgreSQL server.
   - Examples of application-specific databases:
     - `retail_DB` for retail data
     - `HR_DB` for HR-related data

3. **Versioning**:
   - PostgreSQL supports multiple versions, and the latest version at the time of this course is 14.

#### **Role of PgAdmin**

1. **PgAdmin as an IDE**:

   - PgAdmin is a client tool for managing PostgreSQL databases, simplifying the process of writing and running SQL queries.
   - It allows users to connect to databases, manage connections, and perform system and application-specific tasks.

2. **Connection Management**:
   - Each database connection in PgAdmin requires four key details:
     - **Host/Address**: Typically `localhost` for local installations.
     - **Port**: Default is `5432`.
     - **Database Name**: The specific database to connect to (e.g., `Postgres`, `retail_DB`).
     - **Username**: The user credentials for the database.

---

#### **System Tasks Using PgAdmin**

- System-level tasks are performed using the `postgres` user and the `Postgres` database:
  - Creating additional databases (e.g., `retail_DB`).
  - Creating new users (e.g., `retail_user`).
  - Granting permissions to users for specific databases.

---

#### **Setting Up a New Database and User**

1. **Database Example**: `retail_DB`

   - A new database (`retail_DB`) will be created for an application.
   - A user (`retail_user`) will be associated with this database.

2. **Connection for Application Tasks**:

   - A new connection in PgAdmin will be created using:
     - **Database Name**: `retail_DB`
     - **Username**: `retail_user`

3. **Granting Permissions**:
   - Permissions will be granted to the `retail_user` for performing tasks like creating tables, querying data, and managing application-specific information.

---

#### **Connection Workflow in PgAdmin**

- For each database, create a separate connection in PgAdmin with a unique connection name (e.g., `Postgres Retail User`).
- Examples:
  - Connection: `PostgreSQL 14` (default connection to `Postgres` database using `postgres` user).
  - Connection: `Postgres Retail User` (connection to `retail_DB` using `retail_user`).

#### **Key Takeaways**

1. **Database Isolation**:

   - Use separate databases for different applications within the same PostgreSQL server for better management and isolation.

2. **Role of PgAdmin**:

   - Simplifies managing and querying databases through an easy-to-use interface.

3. **Multi-Tenancy**:

   - PostgreSQL's multi-tenant architecture supports multiple databases under one server installation.

4. **Permissions and Security**:
   - Users are granted permissions to specific databases to maintain security and separation of concerns.

This foundational setup ensures proper management of PostgreSQL databases and efficient usage of PgAdmin for data engineering tasks.
