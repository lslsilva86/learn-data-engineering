## Data Engineering Essentials Tool Setup

The course "Data Engineering Essentials using SQL, Python, and Spark" begins with a focus on setting up essential tools to effectively follow the curriculum. Key highlights of the setup process are:

1. **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:

   - VS Code is a versatile Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to develop applications in various programming languages, including Python.
   - The course covers how to install and set up VS Code.

2. **Python 3.9**:

   - Python 3.9 installation is essential to develop Python-based data engineering applications.
   - Instructions for integrating Python with VS Code are provided.
   - Ensures Python can be launched via PowerShell (Windows Terminal).

3. **PostgreSQL and PgAdmin**:

   - PostgreSQL installation, including its official installer, is explained.
   - PgAdmin is introduced as a graphical tool to connect and manage the PostgreSQL database.
   - Steps to verify the proper setup of PostgreSQL and PgAdmin are included.

4. **Verification**:

   - Ensures all tools (VS Code, Python, PostgreSQL, and PgAdmin) are installed and functioning correctly.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - After the tool setup, the course will cover setting up learning material for mastering data engineering essentials using SQL, Python, and Spark.

By the end of this section, learners will have all necessary tools installed and ready to use, providing a solid foundation for the course.
