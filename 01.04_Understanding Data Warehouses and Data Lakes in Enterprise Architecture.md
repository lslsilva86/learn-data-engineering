## Understanding Data Warehouses and Data Lakes in Enterprise Architecture

This lecture explains the role of **data warehouses** and **data lakes** in enterprise architecture, particularly in serving reports, dashboards, and advanced applications like machine learning or data publishing. It also outlines how they integrate with purpose-built databases and BI tools to meet organizational data needs.

### Key Points:

#### Purpose of Data Warehouses and Data Lakes:

1. **Data Warehouse**:

   - Built for **reporting and analytics**.
   - Uses **massively parallel processing (MPP)** for handling large-scale data and serving reports/dashboards.
   - Examples: **Snowflake**, **Databricks**, **Teradata**, **GCP BigQuery**, **AWS Redshift**, **Azure Synapse**.

2. **Data Lake**:
   - Functions as **cloud storage** for raw or semi-processed data.
   - Examples of storage platforms:
     - AWS: **S3**.
     - Azure: **Azure Storage**.
     - GCP: **GCS** (Google Cloud Storage).
   - Works alongside data warehouses to manage data pipelines effectively.

#### Integration Workflow:

1. **Purpose-Built Databases**:

   - Act as the original data sources for applications (e.g., transactional systems like Amazon).
   - Types include RDBMS, NoSQL, and search-based databases.

2. **Data Warehouse and Data Lake**:

   - Centralized platforms to aggregate data from various purpose-built databases.
   - Provide the infrastructure for running **BI tools**, **machine learning models**, and **external data publishing**.

3. **Reports and Dashboards**:

   - Created using **BI tools** like Tableau, QlikView, and Power BI.
   - Allow internal and external users to visualize data and derive insights.

4. **Advanced Applications**:
   - Data science and machine learning algorithms leverage data from these platforms.
   - External customers (e.g., Amazon vendors) can access their transactional data via **files** or **REST APIs** sourced from data warehouses or lakes.

#### Technologies Used:

- **Data Warehouses**: Snowflake, Databricks, Teradata, AWS Redshift, GCP BigQuery, Azure Synapse, Cloudera.
- **Data Lakes**: Cloud-based storage (e.g., S3, Azure Storage, GCS).

### Problem Statements Solved by Data Warehouse/Data Lake:

1. **Centralized Data Management**:
   - Aggregates data from diverse sources to provide a unified view.
2. **Scalable Analytics**:
   - Handles large-scale data for advanced reporting and dashboarding.
3. **Advanced Data Applications**:
   - Supports machine learning, data science, and external data sharing.

This architecture enables organizations to build sophisticated data pipelines and applications that cater to internal stakeholders and external customers alike.
