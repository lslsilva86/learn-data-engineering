## Similarities and Differences Between RDBMS and Data Warehouse Technologies

---

#### **Similarities Between RDBMS and Data Warehouse/MPP**:

1. **Data Storage**:
   - Both use **tables**, consisting of **columns**, **data types**, and **rows** (records) to store data.
2. **SQL Usage**:

   - SQL is the primary language used to interact with databases for tasks such as:
     - Data validation.
     - Troubleshooting.
     - Setting up development environments.
   - SQL queries can be executed either directly by developers or indirectly through application frameworks.

3. **Developer Interaction**:
   - Both platforms require developers to work with SQL for tasks like setting up databases, running queries, and debugging.

#### **Differences Between RDBMS and Data Warehouse/MPP**:

| Feature                     | RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)                                               | Data Warehouse/MPP (Massively Parallel Processing)                             |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Purpose**                 | Used for **transactional systems**.                                                         | Used for **analytical systems** and **decision support**.                      |
| **Use Case**                | Online Transaction Processing (**OLTP**).                                                   | Online Analytical Processing (**OLAP**) or Decision Support Systems (**DSS**). |
| **Applications**            | Handles mobile/web apps for real-time tasks like transactions, order tracking, and refunds. | Handles reports, dashboards, and data-driven decision-making.                  |
| **Output**                  | Operates on **transactions** (e.g., purchases, updates).                                    | Generates **reports** and **dashboards** (e.g., profitability, trends).        |
| **Users**                   | Primarily application users and developers.                                                 | Primarily **executives** (e.g., CTOs, directors, VPs).                         |
| **Role in ETL/Engineering** | Acts as a **source** for ETL or data engineering pipelines.                                 | Acts as a **target** for processed data or may occasionally act as a source.   |

#### **Additional Notes**:

- **Technologies**:

  - RDBMS: Oracle, Postgres, MySQL, SQL Server.
  - Data Warehouse/MPP: Snowflake, Databricks, Teradata, AWS Redshift, Azure Synapse, Google BigQuery.

- **Applications**:

  - RDBMS supports **OLTP** for mobile and web applications.
  - Data Warehouse supports **OLAP/DSS** for generating executive dashboards using tools like **Tableau**, **Power BI**, and **QlikView**.

- **SQL Proficiency**:
  - Aspiring data engineers should become proficient in SQL for both RDBMS and Data Warehouse platforms to handle various tasks effectively.
