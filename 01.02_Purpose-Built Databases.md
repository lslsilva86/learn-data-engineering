## Introduction to Purpose-Built Databases

**Purpose-Built Databases** are specialized database technologies designed to handle specific use cases or applications efficiently. These databases are chosen based on the requirements of the application, such as transaction handling, data analysis, or search optimization.

### **Categories of Databases**:

1. **Relational Databases (RDBMS)**:

   - Examples: Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Sybase.
   - Use Case: Transactional systems like purchasing products.

2. **Data Warehouses (MPP Platforms)**:

   - Examples: AWS Redshift, Azure Synapse, GCP BigQuery, Snowflake, Teradata.
   - Use Case: Large-scale data analysis and reporting with massive parallel processing (MPP).

3. **NoSQL Databases**:

   - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra.
   - Use Case: Storing unstructured or semi-structured data, such as user profiles or activity logs.

4. **Search-Based Databases**:

   - Examples: Elasticsearch, Solr.
   - Use Case: Optimized for full-text search or complex queries.

5. **Graph-Based Databases**:
   - Example: Neo4j.
   - Use Case: Data with complex relationships, such as social networks.

### **Practical Examples**:

1. **LinkedIn Application Use Cases**:
   - **User Activity Logs**: Stored in NoSQL databases for scalability.
   - **Premium Features (Transactions)**: Handled by RDBMS for reliability.
   - **User Profiles**: Stored in NoSQL databases to accommodate dynamic data.
   - **Job Recommendations**: Generated using distributed computing frameworks and stored in NoSQL or search-based databases.

### **Purpose-Built Databases in Data Engineering**:

- **Source and Target Databases**:
  - Act as data sources or targets for downstream processing in data engineering.
  - Examples include document databases, graph databases, and search-based databases.
- **Downstream Processing**:
  - Data is typically processed in data lakes or data warehouses for analysis or reporting.
