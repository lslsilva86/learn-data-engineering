## Setting Up and Using PgAdmin with PostgreSQL Server

This lecture explains how to use **PgAdmin**, a management tool for PostgreSQL, to connect and interact with the PostgreSQL server set up in the previous steps. Below are the key steps:

---

#### **Launching PgAdmin**

1. **Accessing PgAdmin**:

   - Open the Windows **Search Window** and search for "PgAdmin."
   - Click on the application to launch it.

2. **Setting the Master Password**:
   - Upon the first launch, PgAdmin will prompt you to set a **Master Password** to secure its interface.
   - Choose a password (e.g., "Vercetti") and click **OK**.

#### **Connecting to PostgreSQL Server**

3. **Connecting to the Server**:

   - Expand the server section in PgAdmin to see the PostgreSQL server installed in the previous lecture.
   - PgAdmin will prompt for the **Postgres Server Password** (set during the server installation).
   - Enter the password (e.g., "Vercetti") and click **OK**.
   - Optional: Check the option to save the password for future convenience.

4. **Validating the Connection**:
   - Once connected, PgAdmin will display the PostgreSQL server and its components.
   - Under the "Databases" section, verify that the default database (`postgres`) is present.

#### **Features of PgAdmin**

- **User Interface**:

  - PgAdmin provides a graphical interface for managing the PostgreSQL server.
  - Tasks like creating databases, tables, and loading data can be handled directly within this tool.

- **CLI Option**:
  - For users comfortable with command-line tools, similar operations can also be performed using PostgreSQLâ€™s CLI.

#### **Key Takeaways**

- PgAdmin is automatically installed alongside the PostgreSQL server during setup.
- It requires two passwords:
  1.  **Master Password**: Secures PgAdmin's interface.
  2.  **Postgres Server Password**: Used to connect to the PostgreSQL server.
- PgAdmin is ready for use to manage databases, create tables, and perform other administrative tasks.
- Future lectures will cover creating databases, tables, and loading data for specific use cases.
